### To use this code: ###

Installation: First install the required packages:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python pillow scikit-learn numpy matplotlib seaborn
```


### Directory Setup: ###
Create the following directory structure:
```angular2html
melanoma-pseudo-annotation/
├── enhanced.py                  # The main code file containing the implementation
├── data/
│   ├── labeled_images/          # Directory for labeled images (input for training)
│   ├── labeled_masks/           # Directory for corresponding masks for labeled images
│   ├── unlabeled_images/        # Directory for unlabeled images (input for generating pseudo-labels)
├── checkpoints/                 # Directory where model checkpoints will be saved
└── results/
    ├── predictions/             # Directory where predicted masks will be saved
    └── visualizations/          # Directory for any visualizations 
```


Update Paths: In the code, update the base_dir variable to point to your dataset location:


bash
```
base_dir = '/home/mhpromit7473/Documents/ISIC_Dataset'  # Change this to your actual path
```
### Run the Code:

bash

```bash
python3 enhance.py
```
This version includes several improvements:


- Added progress printing during training
- Saves loss plots automatically
- Creates checkpoints and predictions directories
- Better progress messaging
- Automatic best model saving

The code will:
```
- Load and prepare the dataset
- Train the U-Net model
- Save the best model based on validation loss
- Generate and save predictions
- Create a loss plot showing training progress
```

Currently, the system is:

- Taking your input melanoma images
- Trying to predict segmentation masks
- Comparing them with the ISIC masks you have

What we SHOULD do is evaluate against ground truth. Here's the improved approach:
Melanoma Evaluation with Ground Truth

```bash
python3 enhance.py
```

Here's what we need to do:

Dataset Organization:
```bash
dataset/
├── images/          # Your melanoma images
├── masks/           # Your predicted masks
└── ground_truth/    # ISIC ground truth masks
```

Evaluation Metrics:


- Dice Coefficient (Overlap measure)
- IoU (Intersection over Union)
- Visual comparison between:

    - Original image
    - Your predicted mask
    - ISIC ground truth mask

    
### Process Flow: ###

```bash
CopyInput Image → U-Net → Predicted Mask
                         ↓
                  Compare with Ground Truth
                         ↓
                  Calculate Metrics
```

To use this:

Update your main code to include the evaluation:

pythonCopy# After training completes:
```bash
evaluation_results = evaluate_model()
```


This will:


- Generate comparison visualizations
- Calculate accuracy metrics
- Create performance graphs
- Save everything in an 'evaluation_results' directory

```angular2html
The key point is: we need to compare your predictions against the ISIC ground truth 
masks to validate how well the model is actually performing at melanoma segmentation.
```
